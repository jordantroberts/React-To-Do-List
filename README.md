# To Do List
I created a simple To-Do list app in React with the help of several tutorials. I wanted further practice with React, which I am currently learning. 

## Using this program
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this repo from the command line.
3. Type `npm srart`, which will load the application.
4. You can begin entering and deleting items to your to-do list :)
